EukDetect relies on a database of eukaryotic marker genes. This can be generated by the user to include specific species, as long as these species have a corresponding NCBI taxonomy ID.

The process to generate a database is as follows:
- identify candidate genes in genomes of interest using BUSCO
- Cluster genes at >97% identity
- mask repetitive regions in genes
- remove genes that are highly masked or size outliers
- build alignment database from input fasta of genes
- create the following precomputed database files for eukdetect: `specific_and_inherited_markers_per_taxid.txt`, `busco_taxid_link.txt`, and `taxid_cumulativelength.txt`.
- store NCBI taxonomy database release to for ete3
- ideally, sanity check this database for any problematic markers by running the EukDetect pipeline with either real or simulated microbiome sequencing data.




Requirements:
- busco>=5.0.0
- cd-hit-est
- repeatmasker
